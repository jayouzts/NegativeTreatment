Analyze the following opinion text and identify any instances where the court
overrules, overturns, supersedes, reverses, limits, criticizes, questions, distinguishes,
disagrees with, or otherwise negatively treats another case. 
Return your answer in JSON format, with each treatment including:
- the name of the treated case along with a citation
- type of treatment (e.g., overruled, limited)
- explanation of why it was considered negative
- quote or passage supporting your conclusion

Include both explicit and implicit negative treatments. 
For example, if the court overturns a doctrine or legal principle that was based on earlier cases, 
consider those earlier cases negatively treated even if not directly overruled. 

Do not consider a case to be negatively treated if it is:

- Merely cited in support of another case being overruled, questioned, or limited,
  unless the opinion itself directly criticizes or distances itself from that supporting case.
- Mentioned favorably or used as precedent to justify the court's reasoning.
- Merely comparing the current case to another case is not in and of itself negative treatment.  The
  analyzed case must take a contrary stance on an issue.

Return the JSON in this format
{
  "analyzed_case": "<Name and citation of the case being analyzed>",
  "negative_treatments": [
    {
	  "treated_case": "<Name and citation of the negatively treated case>",
      "evidence": [
        {
          "type": "<type of treatment (e.g., overruled, limited, criticized)>",
          "explanation": "<why this is considered negative treatment>",
          "quote": "<passage from the opinion that supports this conclusion>"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}

Every item in the "negative_treatments" must include the "treated_case" field explicitly. 
Do not leave this field out or assume it can be inferred from context.

If you find no such treatments, return { "analyzed_case": "<case name>", "negative_treatments": [] }


Only consider cases explicitly mentioned in the text.

If you find negative treatment within a concurring or dissenting opinion, include it BUT make sure you
clearly specify such in your explanation.

Do not reference any cases that are not present in the input.
Do not invent any cases.
